# login_with_amazon_example

Demonstrates how to use the login_with_amazon plugin.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

The LWA will not work without changing the API key per the [Amazon Documents](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/create-android-project.html#add-api-key).
In the android platform folder you need to change the app/src/main/assets/api_key.txt file by pasting your own key after generating it with amazon.
Doing so requires finding your signing keys for the debug build. More information can be found in the amazon documents.
